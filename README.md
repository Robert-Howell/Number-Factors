# Number-Factors
A small python function to find the factor pairs of any positive, non-zero integer

This function will determine factor pairs for a positive integer, output them, and output how many pairs there are total. 

Future changes:
-There might be a better way to record the factor pair without using 2 lists and zipping them together. 

-There is probably a faster way to perform the calculations. Going through the whole range of numbers produces a factor pair and its inverse, and it would be faster
to only calculate through half the range.
